# Regular Mall Visiting Customers Sentiment Analysis Project

## üìÖ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of regular mall visitors based on customer reviews. The goal is to classify customer sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) using machine learning techniques and gain insights to help businesses improve their customer experience.

## üöÄ Key Highlights
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed in-depth analysis of customer sentiment distribution, common words, and review patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created relevant features from the text data and applied **TF-IDF** for feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Built multiple models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Naive Bayes** for sentiment classification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Achieved 92% accuracy in predicting customer sentiment and evaluated model performance using confusion matrices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Numpy**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **WordCloud**  
- **NLTK**

## üîç Project Details

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gathered customer reviews from a dataset of regular mall visitors.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized sentiment distribution and key text features using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**.
- Generated a **WordCloud** of the most frequent words in reviews to understand customer sentiments better.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Used text length and word count as additional features.
- Applied **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
- Experimented with **n-grams** to capture contextual information.

### 4. Machine Learning Model
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Trained various machine learning models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Naive Bayes**.
- Tuned hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.
- Evaluated models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**.

### 5. Model Results
- Achieved **92% accuracy** in sentiment classification.
- Visualized model performance with confusion matrices to understand false positives and negatives.
